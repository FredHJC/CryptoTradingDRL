# CryptoTradingDRL
This is the repo for our Deep Learning Final Project. 
It is designed to implement state-of-the-art 
deep reinforcement learning models to carry out crypto day-trading. In addition, 
we also implement a novel ensemble method that dynamically ensemble DRL agents in trading sessions. 

This repo contains the main modules developed for our project. However, there are also many modifications in three other repos to fit our demand. \

Please note these repos are forked from the open-source library FinRL.
